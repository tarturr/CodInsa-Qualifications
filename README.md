# Cod'Insa - Qualifications

## What is Cod'Insa ?

From https://codinsa.org/ :

> "The Cod'INSA competition is a free annual computer science competition created by and for students at France's INSAs. For students, it's a chance to compete in a fun way, but also, and above all, to meet up and share a common passion! The competition takes place in two stages: qualifying rounds, organised in each INSA with the aim of selecting a team of five students, and a final, where the latter will have to go and challenge the other INSAs during a weekend combining games and competition.<br>Since 2020, the competition has also been open to former INSA students (Alumni). After qualifying, they will be able to put together a team from among the top 5 alumni from all cities."
